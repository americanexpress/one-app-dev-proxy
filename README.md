## oneAppDevProxy( [options] )

### options

#### useMiddleware

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`<br>
provides the option of whether to apply provided middleware to `one-app-dev-proxy` server.

#### pathToMiddleware

Type: `string`
path to a file exporting an express middleware function by the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

#### remotes

requests to remotes provided in the `remotes` option.
